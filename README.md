<p>Hotel Booking is governed by many factors including the time of the year, number of guests, distribution channel, hotel type, etc. The main aspect of this project is to perform Exploratory data analysis and draw insights to understand all the important factors that govern the Hotel bookings</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Steps Involved</h2>

● Importing Important Libraries - Our main motive through this step was to import all the important libraries to help us explore the problem statement and perform EDA
to draw conclusion on the basis of the data set.

● Understanding the data set and Null Values treatment 

● Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate, Hotel wise and Time Wise analysis has been done to gain inferences from visualizations

<h2>:floppy_disk: Conclusion</h2>
<li>Type A room is in most demand.</li>
<li> Most bookings were made from online travel agents.</li>
<li>Most customers are from Portugal.</li>
<li>Most customers prefer the Bed and breakfast meal type.</li>
<li> City hotels are more engaging and in demand. Hence, city hotels are more profitable.</li>
<li>City hotels receive a higher number of guests than the resort hotels. However, the cancellation rate is more for city hotels.
<li>City hotels have a higher number of repeat customers. However, the ratio of repeat customers is more for resort hotels as the city hotels receive a higher number of guests than the resort hotels. Non-refundable deposits tend to convert to a successful transaction.</li>
<li>May is the busier and most profitable month for the hotels in 2017.</li>
<li> On an average, May-June is the busier and most profitable month for the hotels. City hotels have received the most special requests. 1 number of requests is the
highest. 1 car parking was needed for most of the guests.</li>
