<h1 align="center"> Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Booking Analysis </h1>
<h3 align="center"> AlmaBetter Verfied Project - <a href="https://www.almabetter.com/"> AlmaBetter School </a> </h5>

<p>Hotel Booking is governed by many factors including the time of the year, number of guests, distribution channel, hotel type, etc. The main aspect of this project is to perform Exploratory data analysis and draw insights to understand all the important factors that govern the Hotel bookings</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data Description</h2>

<p>The dataset contained over three types of data like Numerical, Categorical and binary, and they are listed below</p>

**hotel**: The category of hotels, which are two city hotel and resort hotel.

**is_cancelled** : The value of column shows if the booking was canceled or not. Values(0,1), where 0 indicates not canceled and 1 indicates the cancellation.

**lead_time** : The time between reservation and actual arrival.

**stayed_in_weekend_nights**: The number of weekend nights stay per reservation. 

**stayed_in_weekday_nights** : The number of weekday night stays per reservation.

**meal**: Meal preferences per reservation, which are:  Undefined/SC – no meal, package, BB – Bed & Breakfast, HB – Half board (breakfast and one other meal – usually dinner),  FB – Full board (breakfast,lunch and dinner)

**Country**: The origin country of guest

**market_segment**: This column shows how reservation was made and what is the purpose of reservation. Eg,corporate means corporate trip, TA for travel agency and TO for tour operators.

**distribution_channel**: The medium of booking was Corporate, Direct,GDS, TA/TO, undefined

**Is_repeated_guest** : Shows if the guests have arrived the hotel before or not. Values 0,1-->0 indicates no, and 1 indicates yes.

<h2> :floppy_disk: Steps Involved</h2>

● Imprting Important Libraries - Our main motive through this step was to import all the important libraries to help us explore the problem statement and perform EDA
to draw conclusion on the basis of the data set.

● Understanding the data set and Null Values treatment 

● Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate, Hotel wise and Time Wise analysis has been done to gain inferences from visualizations

<h2> :clipboard: Future Work</h2>
<li>Models are not exhaustive. Other models could perform better.</li>
<li>To Get more computational resources to tune XGBoost parameters.</li>
<li>Acquire more customer data and useful features like customer income.</li>

<h2>:floppy_disk: Conclusion</h2>
<p>The dataset was not normally distributed and mostly it was right skewed. There is NO significant difference in the proportion of default payment across different education levels. But clients who have lower than high school level education tend to have default payment more. Married clients have a higher default payment rate than single or other marital status clients. People who have the payment delay for two months have a high ratio of default next month (October). In September, a quarter of customers who repay one month later have default payment next month in October. This situation does not exist in other months as almost no one repay one month later The developed models took into account all possible factors and data. This final chosen model would benefit the bank before they make any decisions against that customers.</p>
